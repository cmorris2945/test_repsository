'''
Script Name: scrape_providers.py

Description:
This script is designed to scrape provider data (specifically cancer doctors) from hospital websites such as MD Anderson, Mayo Clinic, Stanford, and others. 
The goal is to gather key information about cancer specialists to build a database that can be integrated into the DrBot.Health platform for use in the AI-powered doctor recommendation system.

Functionality:
- Connects to hospital websites, navigates to the relevant sections (e.g., oncology departments, doctor directories).
- Extracts data such as doctor names, specialties, contact information, and other relevant details.
- Cleans and formats the data for storage in a database.
- Integrates the scraped data into the existing project database for use in the recommendation system.

Usage:
- Run this script independently to update or refresh the cancer doctor database.
- The data will be stored in the projectâ€™s main database, which is connected to the web app and dashboard.

Dependencies:
- BeautifulSoup (for parsing HTML)
- Requests (for sending HTTP requests)
- pandas (for data manipulation)
- SQLAlchemy (for database interaction)
